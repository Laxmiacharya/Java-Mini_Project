# Java-Mini_Project
Our project title is "Bearing Angle Converter Application," which is designed for angle conversion between degrees, minutes, and seconds to decimal degrees. It also includes bearing conversion from whole circle bearing to quadrant bearing and vice versa. Additionally, the application can plot these angles on a whole circle bearing figure.
